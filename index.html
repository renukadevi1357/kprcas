        <p>The movie "Remo" received mostly positive reviews, with praise for Sivakarthikeyan's performance as a female nurse and the film's background score, soundtrack, cinematography, and comedy. However, it faced criticism for glorifying stalking and the way Keerthy Suresh's character was written. The film is a cute romantic comedy that appeals to its target audience, with Sivakarthikeyan carrying the whole film on his shoulders.
